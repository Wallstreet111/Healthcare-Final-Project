# Predicting Disease Outcomes from Lifestyle Factors
Heart disease is a leading cause of death worldwide. This project aims to understand the relationship between various lifestyle factors and the risk of heart disease. Utilizing data from a comprehensive study, I investigate how factors such as smoking history, alcohol consumption, and BMI influence heart disease risk. By modeling these variables and analyzing their impact, I seek to provide insights into the correlation between lifestyle choices and heart disease susceptibility. This project was created as a part of David Kane's Data Science course to explore predictive modeling in the medical field.
